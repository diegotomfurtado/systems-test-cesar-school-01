# systems-test-cesar-school-01

The purpose of this project is to show a basic project with viable testing architecture to automated web tests using Selenium WebDriver, Java as the programming language and Cucumber.

## Test architecture
We know that any automation project starting with a good test architecture. This project can be your initial test architecture for a faster start. You will see the following items in this architecture:

* Use of Page Objects patters
* Common Methods
* Configuration through a properties file
* Use a Liferay Framework to improve the properties file

Do you have any other item to add on this test architecture? Please do a pull request or open an issue to discuss
